Migration Parameters Guide
==========================

What are migration parameters
-----------------------------

Resource YAML files generated by OS Migrate when exporting are
editable by the user. The parameters in ``params`` section of a
resource generally specify direct resource properties, i.e. *what* the
resource is like. Sometimes, a resource can be copied from source to
destination in multiple different ways, each suitable for different
use cases. To control *how* an individual resource should be migrated,
there is another editable section in resource serializations, called
``_migration_params``. The descriptions of the most important ones are
in this guide.

Workloads
---------

- ``boot_disk_copy`` controls how if the boot disk of the destination
   server is copied or re-imaged:

   -  ``false`` means that the destination server will be booted from a
      Glance image of the same name as the source server. (This is the
      default for servers which were booted from an image in the
      source cloud.)

   -  ``true`` means that the source server's boot disk will be copied
      into the destination as a volume, and the destination server
      will be created as boot-from-volume. (For servers which are
      already boot-from-volume in the source cloud, this is the
      default and the only possible path.)
