Configuring variables in os-migrate
===================================

The goal of this document is to guide users to correctly configure the
variables requires to migrate resources from one tenant/project to
another. Depending on the environment, parameters like the flavor that
will be used to deploy the conversion host must be configured prior to a
migration, these parameters can vary as they depend on how each tenant
was configured. All these parameters are centered over the conversion
host configuration.

Conversion host parameters
--------------------------

The following parameters are those that need to be configured prior to
running os_migrate.

Conversion host external network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The external network configuration allows the connection of the
conversion host router for external access, this external network must
be able to allocate floating IPs reachable between both conversion
hosts.

The parameters to be configured are:

-  ``os_migrate_src_conversion_external_network_name``
-  ``os_migrate_dst_conversion_external_network_name``

Usually, these parameters can be configured to ‘public’ or
‘external_network’ but it depends on how they were configured by the
administrators of the system.

Conversion host flavor name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conversion host flavor defines the compute, memory, and storage
capacity that will be allocated in this guest. It needs to have at least
a volume with 20GB.

The parameters to be configured are:

-  ``os_migrate_src_conversion_flavor_name``
-  ``os_migrate_dst_conversion_flavor_name``

Usually, ‘m1.medium’ will suffice this requirement, but again, it can be
different between deployments.

Conversion host image name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conversion host image is the guest configure to execute the
instances migrations.

The parameters to be configured are:

-  ``os_migrate_src_conversion_image_name``
-  ``os_migrate_dst_conversion_image_name``

This image must be pre-uploaded to both tenants/projects prior to
executing the os-migrate playbooks.
